# Intruduction
MeteorBB is based on [Telescope](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope), a well-formed code for forum with awesome fetures. Keeping friendly to chinese developer and users, MeteorBB will retain most features of Telescope and do some further development.


# Why We Name It MeteorBB

In honor of NodeBB, MeteorBB's slogan is ` No Meteor No BB ` , coooooool!
